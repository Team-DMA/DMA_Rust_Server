Video instructions - Coming soon


Place the program in a folder where u want the server files to be downloaded to. Dont run the program on your desktop, several files and folders will be created. 


------------------------------
The program should be very straight forward.

The progress panel at the top right shows you what to do.


SteamCMD will be used to automaticly download the Rust Server files.

Start By downloading steam cmd. (step one)


Click on Download Server Files (step two) when step two is highlighted.
This can take a few minutes. Wait for it to finish, dont close the black screen, it will close itself when done.

You can already configure and generate your server start files while the rust files are downloading.
Just make sure you wait with trying to run your server untill steamCMD is fully finished downloading the rust Server Files.

Once steam cmd is finished and you generated a start file, click open start file directory on the right and double click on the start file you want to use.

Have fun.
