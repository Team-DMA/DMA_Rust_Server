Hey man!
I have some great news for you. Me and cartographer Gruber created the discord community Mad Mappers and we want to invite you there. 

What is it for? Why do you need it? You'll find out now.

1) For a long time, our customers were interested in whether we have a discord server. Now there is!
2) Exclusive works.
There will be published maps and monuments that can not be viewed or obtained on any other site. 
3) More free works.
For @Verified Customers , we will be posting more free works.
4) Giveaway.
We do not yet know exactly how they will be held, but we will definitely hold #giveaway in which you can get our work.
5) Teasers.
There you can find out about the upcoming maps or monuments, before their official release.
6) Ideas for work.
In a #ideas-for-work , you can send us ideas for your work, and the most interesting ones will " come to light."And the main thing is that the author of the idea will get the job completely free of charge.
7) Communication.
There you can ask us your questions or just ask how we are doing
8) Collaborative project.
Perhaps in the near or distant future, we will present #⣄collaborative-project⠙. It will definitely be something very big, majestic and interesting.
9) 9) Updates.
We will notify users which maps will be updated first before the release of the global update from the developers. 
You will be able to use them as soon as the update is uploaded to the main rust branch.

P.S. Для того, чтобы на вашем сервере работали кастомные IO цепочки и пазлы, кастомные ящики с лутом 
и кастомные магазины, вы должны установить расширение для оксида. Скачать: https://github.com/k1lly0u/Oxide.Ext.RustEdit
